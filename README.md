This error occurs because the `format` field isn't a valid key in the `attributes` processor configuration. Let's fix this with a proper timestamp conversion configuration:

### Correct Configuration for Timestamp Alignment
```yaml
processors:
  # First: Extract timestamp from log using regex
  attributes/extract_timestamp:
    actions:
      - key: log_timestamp  # Source attribute from your logs
        action: extract
        pattern: (?P<timestamp>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})
        regex: true

  # Second: Convert string timestamp to actual time type
  time:
    parse:
      format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"
      layout_type: strptime
      parse_from: attributes.timestamp
```

### Full Working Pipeline Configuration
```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [/var/log/app/*.log]
    operators:
      - type: regex_parser
        regex: '^(?P<timestamp>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})'
        parse_to: attributes

processors:
  # Convert string timestamp to time type
  time:
    parse:
      format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"
      layout_type: strptime
      parse_from: attributes.timestamp

  # (Optional) Remove temporary attributes
  attributes/cleanup:
    actions:
      - key: timestamp
        action: delete

exporters:
  splunk_hec: 
    # ... your existing HEC config ...

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [time, attributes/cleanup, batch]
      exporters: [splunk_hec]
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Removed Invalid `format` Key**  
   The `attributes` processor doesn't support `format` - use dedicated `time` processor instead.

2. **Added Proper Time Conversion**  
   The `time` processor explicitly converts string timestamps to OTLP time format.

3. **Regex Extraction First**  
   Ensure timestamp is extracted to attributes before conversion.

### Verification Command
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c splunk-otel-collector | grep -A 10 'LogRecord'
```

You should now see:
```log
LogRecord #0
ObservedTimestamp: 2025-05-10 20:18:42.614 +0000 UTC
Timestamp: 2025-05-10 20:18:42 +0000 UTC  # Matches observed timestamp!
Body: Str(2025-05-10T20:18:42 -e stdout info...)
```

This configuration will properly align the `Timestamp` (original event time) with `ObservedTimestamp` (collection time) when:  
1. The log timestamp matches your regex pattern
2. Timezone settings are consistent
3. Logs are processed immediately after generation

Let me know if you need help with specific timestamp formats or timezone handling!
